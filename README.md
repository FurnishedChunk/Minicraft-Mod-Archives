This repository contains an archive of community-developed mods that have been released in the last few decades since Minicraft/Minitale was released.  
  
Minicraft/Minitale was published at Ludum Dare 22 in 2011 by Markus Persson, the original author of Minecraft.  
For more information, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicraft).  

Mods not found in the archive can be downloaded from the following developers' Github or official sites.
