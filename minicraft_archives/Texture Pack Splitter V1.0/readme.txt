*Minicraft Texture Pack Editor*
Created By David

Original Description:
Note: This is not really useful right now, as no mods use splitted textures yet.

This tool is used to separate the icons.png into separate images. This way, we can have a way to include a better texture system that will make texture-packs work with mods.

How it works:
1.) You browse and select the icons.png image (There is an option to select other png files)

2.) Select wither you want it in a folder or a zip file (If you don't select ZIP, it will be a folder)

3.) Press the split button.

*3a.) The split process creates a temporary folder and splits the image into 8x8 squares. Then it puts the squares into the folder (ignoring the pink squares). Each square is given an id name based on it's position in the image.

*3b.) Then it goes through a stitching process where it puts the squares into the correct images based on the Id name.

4.) It will put the folder/zip in the same location as the icons.png. The name of the folder/zip is "SplitTexturePack". Now edit it as you please :)
