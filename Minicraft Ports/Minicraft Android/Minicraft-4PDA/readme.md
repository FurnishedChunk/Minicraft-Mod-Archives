# Minicraft Android Port 
  
>Probably, it was previously released on Android Market (Google Play).
It was released in 4PDA and there are custom versions such as removing ads.

It does not work with the currently supported Android 12 / API 31 or later, but we have uploaded an APK that has been edited to work.
**However, use at your own risk.**
